      <p>My name is Giancarlo but I always introduce myself as Gio, for short. It's just easier that way. I'm a Florida boy. Born in Palm Beach, then moved to Broward where I lived until sophomore year of high school. I then moved to Orlando for three years and finished up my high school over there. I moved back to South Florida, Miami to be exact, after high school for college. Spending time with family and close friends is super important and valuable to me. My hobbies include aviation, snorkeling, skiing, off-roading in my Jeep, and anything else that's adventurous and fun!</p>

        <p>I created a tip calculator for class. It only requires three values in order to work; the bill total, percent of tip, and the number of people dining/paying. The code is open to the public on GitHub in the repository "Tip_Calc".</p>
